Feedback from other cohorts when Pair Programming at Makers. 

## Xain Storey

Feedback: Scott had a lot of patience whenever we were stuck on a problem together. He took the time to research possible solutions and suggest them during brainstorms, and gave me ample space & time to express my own thoughts. He's incredibly easy to bounce ideas off of, and he helped my own thought processes by offering alternative ideas to problems we discussed. He also understands the logic behind software, which makes it much easier to conceptualise problems in a new language.
